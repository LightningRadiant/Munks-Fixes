# Munks-Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are just a collection of configs and patches for some annoying issues I found in my KSP playthrough.
Mostly, this mod provides VAB Organizer support for some mods and fixes the bulkhead profiles of parts in some other mods. It also fixes some issues in stock.

Dependencies: Module Manager, VABOrganizer (but even if you don't have VABOrganizer, it can still fix the bulkhead profiles of some parts and remove deprecated ones)

You shouldn't have any problems with mod conflicts, as this is just a collection of MM patches, but if a certain patch is giving you problems, you can just delete it.
You might also want to install KSP community fixes (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/204002-18-112-kspcommunityfixes-bugfixes-and-qol-tweaks/) or else some of the manufacturer fixes may display wrong.

If you have a craft that won't load because of removed deprecated parts, that patch can be safely deleted and the part will be back.

Send me a message on the forums (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/236864-munktron239/) and I'll look into any problems you may find.
