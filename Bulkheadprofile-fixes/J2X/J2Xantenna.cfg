//technically should be size 2, but I instead measured the diameter of the antenna itself (so it won't mess up the order of the stock relay antennas)

// remove surface attachment because.. it cant surface attach? and doesn't make sense NEEDS an in-line part anyways

// same reasoning as above, radius is actually bigger than this but 10m is the "biggest" NEEDS most mods
